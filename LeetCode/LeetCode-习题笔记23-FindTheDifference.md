Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

	
	/**
	 * @param {string} s
	 * @param {string} t
	 * @return {character}
	 */
	var findTheDifference = function(s, t) {
	    let ascii = 0;
	    for (let tChar of t) {
	        ascii += tChar.charCodeAt(0);
	    }
	    for (let sChar of s) {
	        ascii -= sChar.charCodeAt(0);
	    }
	    return String.fromCharCode(ascii);
	};
